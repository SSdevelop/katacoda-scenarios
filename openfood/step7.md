## Testing

Let us first install our testing library **pytest**.
`pip install pytest`{{execute}}

Now, check if we are in correct folder or not by executing `pwd`{{execute}}

If the current folder is not OpenFoodAPI, and it is root, change it by using `cd OpenFoodAPI`

*In short, make sure you are in the correct folder.*

Execute the unit tests by using:
`pytest tests/unit.py`{{execute}}
