## Clone the Repository

`git clone https://github.com/SSdevelop/OpenFoodAPI`{{execute}}

This will clone the repository into your root folder.

## Run the docker containers

Once the repository is cloned, change the directory to OpenFoodAPI, and run the containers by following command.
`cd OpenFoodAPI`{{execute}}
`docker-compose up --build`{{execute}}

It might take some time to run the containers. So, open a new tab in the terminal `echo "helloo"`{{execute T2}} and run:

`docker ps`{{execute}}

This will give you the information on current running containers.
