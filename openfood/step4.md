## Opening Kibana

To collect the logs, we have also configured the EFK (Elasticsearch, Fluentbit, Kibana) stack.

As the containers are configured and running, we can look at the metrics.
If you are running on your localhost, open:
`localhost:5601`

If you are using Katakoda, open:
https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-5601-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com

There, navigate to OpenFoodAPI dashboard to look at the metrics while accessing different links of the API.
